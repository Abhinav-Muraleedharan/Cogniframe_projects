Class / Method Structure:


User inputs model / gemoetry - that defines 
node topology. 

From node topology and initial conditions:

1. Classical simulation.py would run classical simulation of the problem. 
2. Quantum Simulator would run quantum simulation. 

Question is how to organize the code? 

It would be better to have seperate simulator modules, that takes
in spec and perform desired simulation.
